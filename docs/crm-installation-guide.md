## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 12.x
- Filament 4.x (already installed)
- MySQL/PostgreSQL database
- Composer
- npm or yarn

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup

The migrations are already created and have been run. If starting fresh:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Seed Sample Data

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=CRMSeeder
```

This creates:
- 1 Default Pipeline ("Standard Sales") with 6 stages
- 5 Lost Reasons
- 5 Sample Customers
- 6 Sample Opportunities
- Sample Activities

### Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies

The Kanban board uses SortableJS for drag-and-drop:

```bash
npm install sortablejs
npm run build
```

Alternatively, the board loads SortableJS from CDN, so this step is optional.

### Step 4: Clear Caches

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:cache-components
```

### Step 5: Create Storage Link (for Attachments)

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

## Configuration

### File Upload Configuration

Ensure `config/filesystems.php` has the public disk configured:

```php
'public' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
    'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
    'visibility' => 'public',
],
```

### Permissions (Optional - Using Simplified Policies)

The current implementation uses simplified email-based permissions:
- **Admin**: Users with email containing `admin@example.com`
- **Sales Manager**: Users with email containing `manager`
- **Sales Rep**: All other users

To implement full Spatie Permission package:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider"
php artisan migrate
```

Then update the policies in `app/Policies/` to use:
```php
$user->hasRole('admin')
$user->hasRole('sales_manager')
$user->hasRole('sales_rep')
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Access the CRM Section

Login to Filament admin panel and navigate to:

**URL**: `http://your-app.test/admin`

You'll see the **CRM** navigation group with:
- Customers
- Pipelines
- Pipeline Board
- Opportunities
- Reports & Forecast

### 2. Test Customer Management

**Navigate to**: CRM > Customers

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] Create a new customer
- [x] Edit customer details
- [x] View customer's opportunities in relation manager
- [x] Create opportunity from customer page
- [x] Filter by owner
- [x] Search by name/email

### 3. Test Pipeline Management

**Navigate to**: CRM > Pipelines

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] View default "Standard Sales" pipeline
- [x] Create a new pipeline
- [x] Edit pipeline details
- [x] View and manage stages in relation manager
- [x] Drag to reorder stages
- [x] Set stage probabilities and forecast categories
- [x] Mark stages as won/lost

### 4. Test Opportunity Management

**Navigate to**: CRM > Opportunities

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] Create new opportunity
- [x] Quick customer creation inline
- [x] Select pipeline and stage (cascading select)
- [x] Enter amount and see forecast calculation
- [x] Override probability
- [x] Add activities

- [x] Change stage (quick action)
- [x] Mark as won
- [x] Mark as lost (with reason)
- [x] View opportunity details
- [x] See deal health widgets
- [x] View activity timeline

**Filters to Test**:
- Pipeline filter
- Stage filter (cascades from pipeline)
- Owner filter
- Status filter
- Closing this month/quarter/next 30 days
- High value filter
- Source filter

### 5. Test Kanban Board (PRIMARY FEATURE)

**Navigate to**: CRM > Pipeline Board

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] Select different pipelines from dropdown
- [x] View opportunities organized by stage
- [x] See column metrics (count, value, forecast)
- [x] See top-level KPIs (Total Pipeline, Forecast, Expected Close, Win Rate)
- [x] **Drag and drop** opportunity between stages
- [x] Move to Won stage (auto-closes as won)
- [x] Move to Lost stage (prompts for reason)
- [x] Filter by owner
- [x] Filter by status
- [x] See updated metrics after move

**Expected Behavior**:
- Smooth drag-and-drop with visual feedback
- Instant persistence (no page reload)
- Success/warning notifications
- Lost reason modal appears when moving to lost stage
- Activity log automatically records stage changes

### 6. Test Reports Page

**Navigate to**: CRM > Reports & Forecast

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] View key metrics dashboard

- [x] View owner leaderboard
- [x] Export CSV (triggers notification)

### 7. Test Business Logic (Observer)

The `OpportunityObserver` automatically logs:

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] Stage change → creates activity note
- [x] Status change → creates activity note
- [x] Owner reassignment → creates activity note
- [x] Amount change >10% → creates activity note
- [x] Moving to won stage → auto-sets status and closed_at
- [x] Moving to lost stage → auto-sets status and closed_at
- [x] Created_by and updated_by auto-filled

**To verify**: View an opportunity's Activity Timeline after making changes

### 8. Test Policies

✅ Test Cases:
- [x] Admin can do everything
- [x] Sales rep can only edit their own opportunities
- [x] Sales manager can edit all opportunities
- [x] Sales rep cannot create/edit pipelines
- [x] Manager can create/edit pipelines

**How to Test**:
1. Create users with different email patterns
2. Login as different users
3. Verify action buttons appear/disappear based on permissions

### 9. Test Widgets

**Opportunity View Page Widgets**:
- Deal Health Widget (next activity, days in stage, inactivity)
- Forecast Card Widget (value, probability, forecast)
- Activity Timeline Widget (recent activities)

**List Page Widgets**:
- Pipeline KPIs (total pipeline, forecast, expected close, win rate)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Kanban board not loading

**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Issue: SortableJS not working

**Solution**:
The board loads SortableJS from CDN. Check console for errors. Ensure:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sortablejs@1.15.0/Sortable.min.js"></script>
```

### Issue: File uploads failing

**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
chmod -R 775 storage/app/public
```

### Issue: Policies not working

**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

Check `AppServiceProvider.php` has policy registrations.

### Issue: Observer not logging activities

**Solution**:
Verify `AppServiceProvider::boot()` has:
```php
\App\Models\Opportunity::observe(\App\Observers\OpportunityObserver::class);
```

Then:
```bash
php artisan config:cache
```

## Performance Optimization

### N+1 Query Prevention

The Kanban board uses eager loading:
```php
Opportunity::with(['customer', 'owner', 'stage'])
```

### Database Indexes

All migrations include proper indexes:
- Foreign keys
- Composite indexes (pipeline_id, stage_id)
- Search columns (name, email)

### Caching Recommendations

For production, cache the following:
```bash
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

## Advanced Customization

### Adding Custom Stage Actions

Edit `OpportunityResource.php` table actions:
```php
Tables\Actions\Action::make('custom_action')
    ->label('Custom Action')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-star')
    ->action(function ($record) {
        // Your logic
    }),
```

### Adding Custom Metrics

Edit `PipelineKpis.php`:
```php
Stat::make('Custom Metric', $value)
    ->description('Description')
    ->color('success'),
```

### Customizing Board Columns

Edit `opportunity-board.blade.php` to add fields to cards:
```blade
<div>{{ $opportunity->custom_field }}</div>
```

### Email Notifications

Add to `OpportunityObserver`:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;

public function updated(Opportunity $opportunity): void
{
    if ($opportunity->wasChanged('stage_id')) {
        $opportunity->owner->notify(new OpportunityStageChanged($opportunity));
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Policy Enforcement**: All resources check policies before actions
2. **Input Validation**: Filament handles validation automatically
3. **SQL Injection**: Using Eloquent ORM prevents SQL injection
4. **XSS Protection**: Blade templates auto-escape output
5. **File Upload**: Limited to specific types and sizes
