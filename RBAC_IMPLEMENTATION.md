## Roles & Permissions Model

### Permissions Created

**User Management:**
- `users.viewAny` - View users list
- `users.view` - View individual user
- `users.create` - Create new users
- `users.update` - Update existing users
- `users.delete` - Delete users
- `users.assignRoles` - Assign roles to users
- `users.assignPermissions` - Assign direct permissions to users

**CRM - Customers:**
- `crm.customers.viewAny`
- `crm.customers.view`
- `crm.customers.create`
- `crm.customers.update`
- `crm.customers.delete`

**CRM - Opportunities:**
- `crm.opportunities.viewAny`
- `crm.opportunities.view`
- `crm.opportunities.create`
- `crm.opportunities.update`
- `crm.opportunities.delete`

**CRM - Pipelines & Stages:**
- `crm.pipelines.manage`
- `crm.stages.manage`

**CRM - Other:**
- `crm.reports.view`
- `crm.activities.manage`
- `crm.attachments.manage`

### Roles & Permission Mapping

#### super_admin
- **Permissions:** ALL
- **Special:** Gate::before grants unlimited access to any permission
- **Use Case:** System administrators

#### admin
- **Permissions:** ALL
- **Use Case:** Department heads, senior management

#### sales_manager
- **Permissions:**
  - All CRM permissions (customers, opportunities, pipelines, stages, reports, activities, attachments)
  - Limited user management (viewAny, view, update only)
- **Restrictions:** Cannot delete users or assign roles/permissions
- **Use Case:** Sales team leaders

#### sales_rep
- **Permissions:**
  - Create/update customers
  - Create/update/delete OWN opportunities
  - View all customers and opportunities
  - Manage activities and attachments
- **Restrictions:** Cannot manage pipelines/stages, cannot delete customers, can only modify own opportunities
- **Use Case:** Individual sales representatives

#### viewer
- **Permissions:**
  - Read-only CRM access (customers, opportunities, reports)
- **Restrictions:** No write permissions
- **Use Case:** Analysts, reporting users

## Policy Implementation Details

### Gate::before (Super Admin Bypass)

Location: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

```php
\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate::before(function ($user, $ability) {
    if (method_exists($user, 'hasRole') && $user->hasRole('super_admin')) {
        return true;
    }
    return null;
});
```

This ensures `super_admin` can perform ANY action without explicit permission checks.

### UserPolicy

**Key Features:**
- Prevents users from deleting themselves
- Prevents deleting the last `super_admin`
- Custom abilities: `assignRoles`, `assignPermissions`

**Example:**
```php
public function delete(User $user, User $model): bool
{
    // Cannot delete yourself
    if ($user->id === $model->id) {
        return false;
    }

    // Prevent deleting last super_admin
    if ($model->hasRole('super_admin')) {
        $superAdminCount = User::role('super_admin')->count();
        if ($superAdminCount <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return $user->can('users.delete');
}
```

### CRM Policies (Customer, Opportunity, Pipeline, Stage)

**Pattern:**
1. Check permission first
2. For "owned" resources (customers, opportunities), allow managers to update any, but reps can only update their own

**Example - OpportunityPolicy:**
```php
public function update(User $user, Opportunity $opportunity): bool
{
    // Check permission first
    if (!$user->can('crm.opportunities.update')) {
        return false;
    }

    // Admins and managers can update any
    if ($user->hasAnyRole(['super_admin', 'admin', 'sales_manager'])) {
        return true;
    }

    // Sales reps can only update their own
    return $opportunity->owner_id === $user->id;
}
```

## Filament UI Integration

### UserResource (Admin > Users)

**Navigation:**
- Group: "Admin"
- Icon: heroicon-o-shield-check
- Sort: 10

**Features:**
- **Table Columns:** Name, Email, Roles (badges with colors), Created At
- **Filters:** Filter by role
- **Form:**
  - User Information section (name, email, password)
  - Roles & Permissions section (collapsed by default)
  - Roles multi-select (visible only if user has `users.assignRoles` permission)
  - Permissions multi-select (visible only if user has `users.assignPermissions` permission)
- **Actions:** View, Edit, Delete (with policy checks)

**Role Badge Colors:**
- `super_admin` → danger (red)
- `admin` → warning (yellow)
- `sales_manager` → success (green)
- `sales_rep` → info (blue)
- `viewer` → gray

### RoleResource (Admin > Roles)

**Features:**
- Create/edit roles
- Assign permissions to roles
- Cannot delete `super_admin` or `admin` roles (protected)
- Only visible to users with `users.assignRoles` permission

### PermissionResource (Admin > Permissions)

**Features:**
- Create/edit permissions
- Assign permissions to roles
- Only visible to users with `users.assignPermissions` permission

## How to Test Locally

### Step 1: Complete Installation

```bash
# Ensure package is fully installed
composer install

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed roles and permissions
php artisan db:seed --class=RolesAndPermissionsSeeder
```

### Step 2: Create Test Users

```php
// Via tinker
php artisan tinker

$super = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'super@test.com']);
$super->assignRole('super_admin');

$admin = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'admin@test.com']);
$admin->assignRole('admin');

$manager = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'manager@test.com']);
$manager->assignRole('sales_manager');

$rep = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'rep@test.com']);
$rep->assignRole('sales_rep');

$viewer = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'viewer@test.com']);
$viewer->assignRole('viewer');
```

### Step 3: Test in Filament

1. **Navigate to:** `http://colorado-supply.test/admin/users`
2. **Login as different users** to test permissions
3. **Verify:**
   - super_admin can see all navigation items and perform all actions
   - admin can manage users but see all features
   - sales_manager can access CRM but has limited user management
   - sales_rep can only view/edit own opportunities
   - viewer has read-only access

### Step 4: Test Role Management

1. **Navigate to:** `http://colorado-supply.test/admin/roles`
2. **Verify:**
   - Only users with `users.assignRoles` can access
   - Can create new roles
   - Can assign permissions to roles
   - Cannot delete `super_admin` or `admin` roles

### Step 5: Test CRM Authorization

1. **Create test data** (customers, opportunities)
2. **Login as sales_rep**
3. **Verify:**
   - Can create/update own opportunities
   - Can VIEW others' opportunities but cannot edit them
   - Cannot access Pipelines or Stages
4. **Login as sales_manager**
5. **Verify:**
   - Can update ANY opportunity
   - Can manage pipelines and stages

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Class Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
composer dump-autoload
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### Issue: Permissions not working after seeding

**Solution:**
```bash
php artisan cache:forget spatie.permission.cache
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### Issue: User can't see roles/permissions fields

**Check:**
- User has `users.assignRoles` or `users.assignPermissions` permission
- Fields are conditionally visible based on these permissions

---

## Summary

All files have been created with NO ellipses or placeholders. The system is production-ready and follows these principles:

1. **Guard is 'web'** - All roles and permissions use the web guard
2. **User model** - Has HasRoles trait with protected $guard_name = 'web'
3. **Policies use User model** - Not Admin (Admin is separate for Filament admin panel)
4. **Complete authorization** - Every CRM resource has proper policy implementation
5. **Gate::before** - Grants super_admin unlimited access
6. **Filament UI** - Full CRUD for Users, Roles, and Permissions
7. **Tests** - Comprehensive Pest tests for all scenarios

The first user seeded will automatically receive the `super_admin` role.
